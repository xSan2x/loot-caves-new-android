    "Description": "I have been successfully using ncalc in my project but am stumped on a new calculation that is throwing \"missing EOF at '('\" on Evaluate(). The code that is failing is \"double finalResult = (double)expression.Evaluate();\". The formula string is \"(RetailUnits*RetailUnitCost)â€“((RetailUnits/UnitsPerCase)*WholesaleCaseCost)\" all of the references are available as expression parameters. I've tried reformatting my expression to no avail. Is my syntax incorrect?",
