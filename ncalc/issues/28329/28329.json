    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nit seems like NCalc  is returning a wrong result.\r\n\r\nMy Code:\r\n\r\nstring expression = \"100-100.01\";\r\n\r\nExpression e = new Expression(expression);  \r\nstring resultString = e.Evaluate().ToString();\r\n\r\nIt returns \"0,0100000000000051\" and not \"-0,01\"\r\n\r\nFor \"100-110.01\"  the result is -10,01, which is correct.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nPS: Still have this issue with version 1.3.8",
