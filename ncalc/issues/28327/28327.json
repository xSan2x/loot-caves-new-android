    "Description": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nDo you have any version of NCalc compatible with the latest Antlr3.Runtime version?\r\n\r\nI am having dependencies issues because other NuGet packages I am using require newer versions of it. I couldn't find the Antlr3.Runtime version NCalc is using to embed that version of the source code into my app, so, if you have a link to get the code, that would solve my issue too \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",
