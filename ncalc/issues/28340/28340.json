    "Description": "I found that ncalc can't be used in PCL projects since there is a reference to System.Threading.ReaderWriterLock wich is not supported in PCL Runtime since it has been updated with a new equivalent class (http://msdn.microsoft.com/it-it/library/system.threading.readerwriterlockslim(v=vs.110).aspx). It should be safe and easy to use in place of the old one.",
