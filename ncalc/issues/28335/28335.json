    "Description": "I have a simple expression defined as\r\n\r\n10+10/2\r\n\r\nand would expect the result equalling 10, however I am getting 15 because. I can resolve the issue by bracketing the (10 + 10) / 2 but ideally I don't want to use bracketing. \r\n\r\nIs there any way around this please",

The order of precedence is well documented and doesn't just apply to programming - it is the same across all mathematics.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations\n\nThe only way to change this behavior is to use parenthesis to indicate that the order should be different.",
