    "Description": "It is silly to have ^ to be the XOR operation given that, outside the programming realm, _virtually nobody_ really needs XOR for anything. It is equally silly to type Pow(x,2) when you need x^2. So how about changing the default behavior in order to support ^ as the power operator rather than XOR?",
