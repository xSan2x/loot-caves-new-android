It seems being able to use hex '0x' and binary '0b' notation for numbers would be useful, especially since the &amp; and | operators are supported<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever trying add support for octal would be a terrible idea since no one uses it ever and it causes problems.  In real life 0100 is always meant 100 decimal not 64 decimal.<br />\n",
