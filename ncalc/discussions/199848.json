Is there a way I can check this using NCalc?</p>\r\n<p>In my specific requirement, user indicates that he wants to build a boolean/numeric expression, I need to ensure that the expression that he has supplied indeed results in a boolean/numeric value. Initially I though, just looking for boolean operators in the expression should tell me that, but expressions like (A &amp; B)&nbsp; (bitwise AND) actually results in a numeric value.</p>\r\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>- Vikram</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

In a more scientific way, you can create a specific Visitor implementation for evaluating each node and returning the intended type. Just like the ExpressionVisitor class.</p>",
