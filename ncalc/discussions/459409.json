    "Html": "I see why you would want to add bitwise operators, but I think at least the xor operator should be changed. You see, the '^' character is much more frequently used to refer to exponentiation. Sure, programmers would be more used to using it as a bitwise xor, but many people who would use programs developed using NCalc would be more used to 6^2 being 36, not 4. Not to mention that this could possibly break stuff that relies on '^' meaning &quot;to the power of&quot;. Maybe make the bitwise operators into functions like xor(), and(), etc.?<br />\n",
