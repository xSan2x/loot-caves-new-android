I have to use NCalc in a very heavy formula intensive calculation and i would like to know, is it possible to not to new up for every new expression, rather, create a single class and change the expression as and when the expression changes? This is to\r\n avoid, too much heal allocation.</p>\r\n<p>2. In my case, cache does not provide any value since each and every calculation is unique. Is it possible to disable caching?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n",
